Custom CMOS Library
===================

This folder contains a custom CMOS library ready to use. It has the same components as those found in the main CMOS library, with the difference that the components included here are modeled using circuits schematics instead of embedded models. This allows for easier modification and customization should the user require it.

If you download the whole folder you can include it in your project by adding the folder as a library to Caneda. In Caneda, libraries are folders with schematics and symbols inside. As a general rule, to use any library you must download the selected folder and add it to your library list through the _Application Settings_ dialog in the _Libraries_ section. Any successive change in the library will be reflected upon the next program restart.
